# I Ported SAP to a 1976 CPU. It Wasn't That Slow.

*Or: I built a vector database for SAP, then ported it to a 1976 processor—for ~~science~~ fun*

## When Two Retro Technologies Meet

Last month, I was cleaning up old code and rediscovered ZVDB—a vector database I'd built in ABAP about a year and a half ago. Looking at it again, I had a realization that made me smile.

ABAP (born 1983) and Z80 (born 1976) are practically contemporaries. They grew up in the same era of computing—when memory was precious, cycles were counted, and every byte mattered. No wonder they understand each other so well.

My ZVDB wasn't just written in ABAP. It was ABAP written with 40 years of Z80 wisdom.

## The Kindred Spirits

When SAP created ABAP in 1983, the Z80 was already powering millions of computers worldwide. Both were born from the same constraints:
- **Limited memory** (64KB was luxury)
- **Expensive CPU cycles** (measure twice, compute once)
- **No floating point** (integers or go home)
- **Direct hardware access** (abstractions are for the future)

When I built ZVDB, I deliberately applied every Z80 optimization I knew. Why? Because these "old" techniques are timeless—they just happen to make modern code blazingly fast:

```abap
METHOD dp_1536. "dot product for 1536-bit vectors
  DATA(d) = ix_0 BIT-XOR ix_1.
  " Straight from the Z80 playbook: unrolled loops, lookup tables
  rv_ = rv_ + g[ d+01(2) + 1 ] + g[ d+02(2) + 1 ] + g[ d+03(2) + 1 ]...
  " 96 lookups because memory access beats arithmetic - Z80 taught me this
ENDMETHOD.
```

## Z80 Wisdom Applied to ABAP

Every "trick" in ZVDB came from my Z80 experience:

```abap
" Pre-compute everything - classic Z80 optimization
METHOD init_signed_counter_tab_16bit.
  DO 65536 TIMES.
    " Build 64KB lookup table - because Z80 taught me:
    " one memory read beats eight bit tests
    lx_ = sy-index - 1.
    " ... bit counting logic ...
    APPEND lv_v TO rt_.
  ENDDO.
ENDMETHOD.
```

This wasn't ABAP trying to be clever. This was 40 years of embedded programming saying: "I know exactly how to make this fast."

## The Proof: It Actually IS Z80 Code

When I ported ZVDB to actual Z80 assembly, I barely had to change anything. Because it was already thinking in Z80:

```asm
; This isn't a port - it's a homecoming
compare_vectors:
    LD B, 192       ; Process 192 bytes
    LD IX, 0        ; Accumulator
    
next_byte:
    LD A, (DE)      ; Vector B
    XOR (HL)        ; Vector A
    
    ; The same lookup table optimization
    PUSH HL
    LD H, HIGH popcount_table
    LD L, A
    LD A, (HL)      ; One lookup vs eight bit tests
    POP HL
    
    INC HL          ; Sequential access - the golden rule
    INC DE
    DEC B
    JR NZ, next_byte
    RET
```

## The Numbers That Vindicate Old-School Thinking

- **ZVDB on SAP**: 10-20ms (Z80 algorithms on modern hardware)
- **ZVDB on Z80**: 50-60ms (Z80 algorithms on Z80 hardware)

Only 3-6x slower despite 857x clock speed difference? That's not surprising—**these optimizations were born for the Z80**. They just happen to be universally optimal.

## Why Z80 Thinking Still Wins in 2025

Every Z80 lesson I applied to ABAP remains valid on modern hardware:

1. **Lookup tables are always faster than calculation**
   - Z80: Save those precious cycles
   - Modern CPU: Cache-friendly access patterns

2. **Sequential memory access is king**
   - Z80: One cycle vs four for random access
   - HANA: Columnar storage loves sequential patterns

3. **Bit operations are universal**
   - Z80: Native CPU instructions
   - Modern CPU: SIMD does the same thing, faster

4. **Pre-computation beats runtime math**
   - Z80: Can't afford to calculate
   - Modern systems: Why calculate what you can remember?

## The Beautiful Truth

In 2025, I'm using 1983 technology (ABAP) with 1976 optimizations (Z80) to solve 2020s problems (vector search). And it works brilliantly because **I knew exactly what I was doing**.

Those years with Z80 assembly weren't just nostalgia—they were training. Every cycle counted then, and guess what? Every cycle still counts now. The scale changed. The principles didn't.

When I port this to HANA AMDP, it'll be even faster. Because AMDP will take my Z80-optimized algorithm and parallelize it. But the core insight—lookup beats calculation, sequential beats random—that came from 1976.

## The Real Lesson

The best optimization isn't learning the newest framework. It's understanding the metal—whether that metal is from 1976 or 2025.

**Z80 taught me how computers actually think. 40 years later, they still think the same way—just faster.**
